1. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

Reducers - Reducers help implement the behaviors of the actions.
Store - A place for the actions to be stored while being utilized.
1. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?

1. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
A software or middleware that lets you return functions instead of action objects.
1. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
